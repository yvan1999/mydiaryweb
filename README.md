this website is called MyDiaryWeb and it will be used to add the daily events a person did.But before,this is not a full
working project ,it is a User Interface I've firstly designed using html and few css.But later i'll add other functionalities

Here is the guidance .

firstly visit the web through this link below:

https://yvan1999.github.io/mydiaryweb/index.html

The first index page will be the login form where you will need to pass through to go to your account ,so no worries if you don't have an account you can only check the UI .

Click the create account link below the login button to create an account.

after creating your account ,you can go back to login ,then fill your credentials which will directly take you to your account page 
which holds your account details which can be updated.

click On "Click For More" link then check the entries,click on the X button to delete entry and the pencil button to modify it
